# Cash Alert

## Purpose

I wanted to offer a free solution for organizing school/community fundraisers through Google App Script and HTML, 
providing weekly email reminders and payment management to student organizations, addressing the limitations of 
costly and restrictive alternatives.

I also made my app on Google Sheets because I needed it to be easily accessible to the rest of my class officers 
and so that it wouldn’t be blocked by my school’s restrictive firewall.

I also ended up winning the Congressional App Challenge for my district in 2023!!
